    "**Answer:**  I used the guidance received from the Hyperparameters fine tuning chapter - n_layers - 2 is a gold standard, 3 is sometimes better than 2, but it depends. Good starting point for lr is 0.01, but 0.001 is very often considered better. batch_size - 32,64,128,256. Decided to go with 128. Embedding size between 50 and 200 is good norm, I did 200. hidden_dim should be higher than input size, so 250 should be good starting point. Tried seq length 100, but it was taking too long to train so decided to try with 10. Epochs - started with 5 - reached 3.5 but did not fall below that, decided to increase to 10. It worked. "
